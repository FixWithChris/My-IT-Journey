## 🧠 Types of RAM

| RAM Type     | Description                                 | Common Use Case                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| DRAM         | Dynamic RAM, stores bits in capacitors      | Base memory for PCs             |
| SRAM         | Static RAM, faster but expensive            | CPU cache (L1/L2/L3)            |
| SDR SDRAM    | Single Data Rate SDRAM                      | Older systems                   |
| DDR SDRAM    | Double Data Rate SDRAM                      | Transfers data on both clock edges |
| DDR2 SDRAM   | Faster, lower power than DDR                | Not backward compatible         |
| DDR3 SDRAM   | Higher bandwidth, lower voltage             | Still common in older desktops  |
| DDR4 SDRAM   | Improved speed & efficiency over DDR3       | Current mainstream standard     |
| DDR5 SDRAM   | Latest standard with higher speeds          | Emerging in modern systems      |

## ⚡ RAM Speeds & Specs

| RAM Type | Speeds (MT/s)      | Voltage   | DIMM Pins | SO-DIMM Pins |
|----------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| DDR      | 200–400            | 2.5V      | 184       | 200           |
| DDR2     | 400–1066           | 1.8V      | 240       | 200           |
| DDR3     | 800–2133           | 1.5V/1.35V| 240       | 204           |
| DDR4     | 1600–3200+         | 1.2V      | 288       | 260           |
| DDR5     | 4800–8400+         | 1.1V      | 288       | TBD           |

> **SO-DIMM = Small Outline DIMM**, used in laptops and SFF PCs.

## 🔁 Compatibility Notes

- **Not backward compatible** – You can't mix DDR types (e.g., DDR3 doesn’t fit in a DDR4 slot)
- **Motherboard must match RAM type and speed**
- Always check system/motherboard specs before upgrading

---

> **Exam Tip:** Know the voltage, pin count, and speed ranges of each DDR type. Identify where they're used (laptop vs desktop vs server).
