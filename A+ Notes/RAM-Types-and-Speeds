## **Types of RAM**

| RAM Type     | Description                                      | Notes                           |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| DRAM         | Dynamic RAM, stores bits in capacitors           | Requires constant refreshing    |
| SRAM         | Static RAM, faster and more expensive            | Used in CPU caches              |
| SDRAM        | Synchronous DRAM                                 | Synchronized with system clock  |
| DDR SDRAM    | Double Data Rate SDRAM                           | Sends data on both clock edges  |
| DDR2 SDRAM   | Faster and more efficient than DDR               | Not backward compatible         |
| DDR3 SDRAM   | Higher bandwidth, lower power                    | Common in older systems         |
| DDR4 SDRAM   | Higher speed and efficiency than DDR3            | Used in most modern systems     |
| DDR5 SDRAM   | Increased bandwidth and lower power consumption  | Emerging standard               |

## **Common RAM Speeds (by Type)**

| RAM Type   | Common Speeds (MT/s) | Voltage   | Pin Count (DIMM) | Pin Count (SO-DIMM) |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| DDR        | 200–400              | 2.5V      | 184               | 200                  |
| DDR2       | 400–1066             | 1.8V      | 240               | 200                  |
| DDR3       | 800–2133             | 1.5V/1.35V| 240               | 204                  |
| DDR4       | 1600–3200+           | 1.2V      | 288               | 260                  |
| DDR5       | 4800–8400+           | 1.1V      | 288               | TBD                  |

## **Important Terms**

- **MT/s (Mega Transfers per second)** – Measures RAM speed (not MHz, though often used interchangeably).
- **Latency (CL)** – Lower is faster, but must be balanced with speed.
- **Dual Channel / Triple Channel** – Increases bandwidth by accessing multiple RAM sticks simultaneously.
- **ECC (Error-Correcting Code)** – Detects and corrects internal RAM errors; used in servers.
- **Buffered vs. Unbuffered** – Buffered (registered) RAM is more stable, used in enterprise systems.

## **Troubleshooting RAM Issues**

- **Symptoms of bad RAM**: random crashes, boot errors, BSODs, memory test failures
- **Tools**: MemTest86, Windows Memory Diagnostic
- **Fixes**: reseat RAM, replace module, match speed/type in multi-channel setups

## **Tips for A+ Exam**

- Know the differences between RAM types (e.g., DDR3 vs. DDR4)
- Remember pin counts and voltage
- Be familiar with RAM installation and troubleshooting steps
