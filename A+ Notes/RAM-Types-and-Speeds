## **Types of RAM**

| RAM Type     | Description                                  | Notes                                     |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| DRAM         | Dynamic RAM, stores bits in capacitors       | Requires constant refreshing              |
| SRAM         | Static RAM, faster and more expensive        | Used in CPU cache systems                 |
| SDR SDRAM    | Synchronous DRAM                             | Synchronized with system bus              |
| DDR SDRAM    | Double Data Rate SDRAM                       | Sends data on both clock edges            |
| DDR2 SDRAM   | Faster and more efficient than DDR           | Not backward compatible                   |
| DDR3 SDRAM   | Higher bandwidth, lower power                | Common in older systems                   |
| DDR4 SDRAM   | Higher speed and efficiency than DDR3        | Used in most modern systems               |
| DDR5 SDRAM   | Increased bandwidth and lower power consumption | Emerging standard                     |

## **Common RAM Speeds (by Type)**

| RAM Type | Common Speeds (MT/s) | Voltage       | Pin Count (DIMM) | Pin Count (SO-DIMM) |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| DDR      | 200–400              | 2.5V          | 184              | 200                 |
| DDR2     | 400–1066             | 1.8V          | 240              | 200                 |
| DDR3     | 800–2133             | 1.5V/1.35V    | 240              | 204                 |
| DDR4     | 1600–3200+           | 1.2V          | 288              | 260                 |
| DDR5     | 4800–8400+           | 1.1V          | 288              | TBD                 |
