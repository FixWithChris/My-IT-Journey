## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Methodology (CompTIA A+)

Use these six steps to effectively diagnose and resolve technical issues:

1. **Identify the Problem**
   - Gather information from the user.
   - Observe symptoms and perform basic diagnostics (e.g., test power outlet, check cables).
   - Review documentation, environmental conditions, and any recent changes.

2. **Establish a Theory of Probable Cause**
   - Question the obvious.
   - Consider multiple possibilities (hardware failure, software bug, user error).
   - Narrow down the most likely root causes.

3. **Test the Theory to Determine the Cause**
   - Perform diagnostic tests or swap components to confirm.
   - ✅ If confirmed, proceed to step 4.
   - ❌ If not confirmed, re-establish a new theory and re-test.

4. **Establish a Plan of Action**
   - Design a safe, efficient solution.
   - Minimize disruption to the user or system environment.

5. **Verify Full System Functionality**
   - Confirm the issue is resolved.
   - Check for any secondary issues.
   - Have the user validate functionality if applicable.

6. **Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes**
   - Record what the problem was, what caused it, how it was resolved, and any lessons learned.
   - Useful for future troubleshooting and ticket history.

> 🔁 These steps are not always linear, but they provide a structured foundation for consistent, effective troubleshooting.
