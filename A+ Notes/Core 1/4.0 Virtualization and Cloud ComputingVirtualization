## 🧠 What is Virtualization?

**Virtualization** allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine using a **hypervisor**.

### Key Concepts:
- **Host Machine** – Physical computer running the hypervisor
- **Guest Machine** – Virtual machine running inside the host
- **Hypervisor** – Software that manages VMs

| Type          | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Type 1 (Bare Metal) | Installed directly on hardware (e.g., ESXi) |
| Type 2 (Hosted)     | Runs inside an OS (e.g., VirtualBox, Hyper-V) |

---

## 🛠 Virtualization Requirements

- **CPU Support** – Intel VT-x or AMD-V
- **RAM** – Sufficient memory to support multiple VMs
- **Storage** – Large and fast enough to host virtual disk images
- **Hypervisor Software** – VirtualBox, Hyper-V, VMware Workstation, etc.

## 🖥 VM Features to Know

| Feature         | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Snapshots       | Save VM state before updates or changes       |
| Virtual Switches | Allow communication between VMs or network   |
| NAT / Bridged    | Determines VM's network visibility            |
| Virtual Disk     | File that simulates a hard drive (VHD/VMDK)  |

## ☁️ What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** allows users to access and manage resources (apps, data, infrastructure) over the internet instead of local devices.

### Key Benefits:
- On-demand access
- Scalability
- Cost-effective (pay-as-you-go)

## ☁️ Cloud Types

| Type        | Description                        | Example                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **SaaS**    | Software-as-a-Service              | Google Docs, Office 365          |
| **PaaS**    | Platform-as-a-Service              | Heroku, Google App Engine        |
| **IaaS**    | Infrastructure-as-a-Service        | AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines  |

---

## ☁️ Deployment Models

| Model       | Description                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Public**  | Accessible to anyone (e.g., Google Cloud) |
| **Private** | Internal use within an organization      |
| **Hybrid**  | Mix of public and private cloud         |
| **Community** | Shared infrastructure among orgs      |

## 💡 Exam Tips

- Know the **difference between SaaS, PaaS, IaaS**
- Understand hypervisor types and VM behavior
- Cloud = hosted on remote servers, accessed via browser/app
- Virtualization = locally hosted, managed with hypervisor
