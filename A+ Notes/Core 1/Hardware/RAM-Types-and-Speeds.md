## 📌 RAM Categories

| Type       | Description                                 | Typical Use        |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| DRAM       | Dynamic RAM – must be constantly refreshed  | General system RAM |
| SRAM       | Static RAM – faster, no refreshing needed   | CPU cache (L1/L2/L3) |
| SDR SDRAM  | Single data rate, older tech                | Legacy systems     |
| DDR SDRAM  | Double data rate – transfers on rising and falling clock edges | DDR generations |

## 📊 DDR Generations Breakdown

| Type   | Speed Range (MT/s) | Voltage   | DIMM Pins | SO-DIMM Pins | Common Use             |
|--------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| DDR    | 200–400            | 2.5V      | 184       | 200           | Early desktops/laptops  |
| DDR2   | 400–1066           | 1.8V      | 240       | 200           | Older PCs               |
| DDR3   | 800–2133           | 1.5V/1.35V| 240       | 204           | Widespread legacy use   |
| DDR4   | 1600–3200+         | 1.2V      | 288       | 260           | Current standard        |
| DDR5   | 4800–8400+         | 1.1V      | 288       | 262 (emerging)| Next-gen systems        |

## 💻 SO-DIMM vs DIMM

- **DIMM** – Desktop memory
- **SO-DIMM** – Small Outline, for laptops and compact systems

---

## ⚠️ Compatibility Tips

- DDR generations are **not backward compatible**
- Voltage, pin layout, and notch placement differ per type
- Always check **motherboard specs** before installing

---

## 💡 Exam Tips

- Know pin counts for DDR3 (240), DDR4 (288), DDR5 (288)
- Identify SO-DIMM for laptops (DDR4 SO-DIMM = 260 pins)
- Understand that speed is in **MT/s (mega-transfers per second)**
