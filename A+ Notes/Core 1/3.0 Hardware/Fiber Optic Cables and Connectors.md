## 🔍 Fiber Types

| Fiber Type         | Description                                                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Single Mode**    | Long-distance, small core (9 µm), laser-based light, minimal dispersion |
| **Multimode**      | Short-distance, larger core (50/62.5 µm), LED light, higher dispersion |
| **Subscriber Fiber** | Often used for "last mile" delivery in FTTH (Fiber to the Home) setups |

## 🔌 Connector Types

| Connector Type                     | Description                                               |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **SC (Subscriber Connector)**      | Push-pull locking, square design, common in data centers |
| **ST (Straight Tip Connector)**    | Bayonet-style twist-lock, round shape                    |
| **LC (Lucent Connector)**          | Small form factor, often used in switches and routers    |
| **MTRJ (Mechanical Transfer RJ)**  | Compact duplex connector resembling RJ-style plug        |

## ✅ Summary Notes

- **Single Mode** = Long haul, campus backbone, ISP fiber
- **Multimode** = Office buildings, short runs, high bandwidth at short distance
- **SC & LC** = Most common in enterprise
- **ST** = Older, legacy setups
- **MTRJ** = Space-saving duplex option
