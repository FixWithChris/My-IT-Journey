## ğŸ”Œ Fiber Cable Types

| Cable Type          | Core Size       | Distance Range        | Mode of Light Travel    | Use Case                        | Notes                             |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)** | 8.3â€“10 Âµm        | Long distances (up to 100 km) | Single path             | ISP backbones, WANs             | Higher bandwidth, more expensive   |
| **Multimode Fiber (MMF)**   | 50â€“62.5 Âµm       | Short to mid range (up to 2 km) | Multiple paths          | LANs, Data centers              | Lower cost, modal dispersion      |
| **OM1 (MMF)**        | 62.5 Âµm          | Up to 275 m @ 1 Gbps   | LED light source         | Legacy LANs                     | Orange jacket                     |
| **OM2 (MMF)**        | 50 Âµm            | Up to 550 m @ 1 Gbps   | LED light source         | Upgraded LANs                   | Orange jacket                     |
| **OM3 (MMF)**        | 50 Âµm (Laser optimized) | Up to 300 m @ 10 Gbps | Laser (VCSEL)            | Data centers                    | Aqua jacket                       |
| **OM4 (MMF)**        | 50 Âµm (Enhanced) | Up to 550 m @ 10 Gbps  | Laser (VCSEL)            | High-performance data centers   | Aqua jacket                       |
| **OM5 (MMF)**        | 50 Âµm (Wideband) | Up to 150 m @ 100 Gbps | SWDM Laser               | Emerging tech (100G Ethernet)   | Lime green jacket                 |

## ğŸ”— Common Fiber Connectors

| Connector Type       | Shape           | Use Case                        | Notes                             |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **SC (Subscriber Connector)** | Square push/pull | Data centers, telecom           | Easy to use, snap-in              |
| **ST (Straight Tip)**          | Round, bayonet   | Older networks, legacy systems  | Twist-lock style                  |
| **LC (Lucent Connector)**      | Small form factor | High-density panels, switches  | Most common today                 |
| **MT-RJ**                      | Compact, duplex   | Small devices, office setups    | Two fibers in one connector       |
| **FC (Ferrule Connector)**     | Threaded          | Industrial use, vibration areas | Secure, screw-on                  |

## ğŸ“Œ Tip

- **SMF uses yellow jackets** for cables.
- **MMF uses orange (OM1/OM2), aqua (OM3/OM4), and lime green (OM5)**.

> ğŸ§  _Remember_: Always match **cable mode** with the correct **transceiver and connector** type to avoid signal loss or network issues.
