## ðŸ§µ Fiber Types

| Type             | Description                                                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Single Mode**  | Long-distance, small core, laser light, less signal dispersion         |
| **Multimode**    | Short-distance, larger core, LED light, more dispersion                |
| **Subscriber Fiber** (or Submarine) | Typically used in subscriber drops (FTTH) or long-haul undersea links (clarify based on source) |
