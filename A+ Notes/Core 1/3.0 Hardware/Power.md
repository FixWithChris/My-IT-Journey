# üß† CompTIA A+ Study Notes ‚Äì Power Supply (PSU)

## üîå Power Supply Unit (PSU)

- **Alternating Current (AC)**  
  - Cycled between positives and negatives repeatedly

- **Main Purpose:**  
  - Converts AC to DC to deliver power to all PC components

---

## üîÑ Modular PSU / Modular Power Supply Unit

- Allows unhooking connectors and detaching from the unit
- Frees up internal space in the computer

---

## üîó Power Supply Connectors

### üîπ Main Board / Motherboard Adapter
- Provides power to the motherboard
  - **ATX Standard**: 20-pin connector
  - **ATX 12V**

### üîπ 24-pin Connector / 20+4 Pin  
- 24-pin: Standard
- 20+4: Two connectors combined before plugging into 24-pin slot

### üîπ Processor Power / CPU Power  
- 4-pin, 6-pin, or 8-pin connector

### üîπ Molex Connector  
- For IDE and PATA drives (CD/DVD, etc.)

### üîπ Y Connector  
- One connector that supports multiple devices

---

## üîå Input and Output Voltages

- **120V AC (Low Line Power)**  
  - US-based power

- **230V AC (High Line Power)**  
  - Europe and Asia power

- **Most power supplies support multi-voltage outputs**

- **Voltage Sensing / Dual Voltage Power Supplies**  
  - Auto-detects outlet and adjusts voltage

---

## ‚ö° Rail

- Wire that provides current at a specific voltage

### üî∏ 12 VDC Rail  
- Most common voltage in a PC  
- Cable/wire delivers 12V DC

---

## üîã Wattage Rating

- Defines PSU output capacity or capability

### üí° Formula:  
- Amps √ó Volts  
- Current (I) √ó Voltage (V)

### üí° Peak Power Usage Table:

| Component            | Peak Power Usage |
|----------------------|------------------|
| RX 6700 XT GPU       | 230 W            |
| Top-Tier CPU         | 250 W            |
| Mid-Tier CPU         | 100‚Äì150 W        |
| Motherboard          | 80 W             |
| Optical Drive        | 30 W             |
| 3.5" Hard Drive      | 9 W              |
| M.2 or 2.5" SSD      | 9 W              |
| 120 mm Case/CPU Fan  | 8 W              |

## üîç Efficiency & Power Draw

- **Power supply comes in 50 W or 100 W increments**
- Always buy bigger than calculated
- Example power draw from wall:

| PSU Efficiency | Power Drawn from Wall |
|----------------|------------------------|
| 70%            | 714 W                  |
| 80%            | 625 W                  |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Power supplies are **not 100% efficient**
