## ✍️ Reflections

Today wasn’t just study — it was **integration**.

I organized your entire repo around real exam objectives, created high-quality reference material, and tested your knowledge through hours of recall and reinforcement. This is no longer just preparation. This is a system I'm building to support my future in IT.

I didn’t just learn — I **reclaimed clarity.**
