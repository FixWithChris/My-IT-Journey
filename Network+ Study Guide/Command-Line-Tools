# Networking Commands for A+ / Network+

**Focus:** Core tools to diagnose and resolve network issues

---

## IP Tools

- `ipconfig /all` – View full IP config  
- `ipconfig /release` & `/renew` – DHCP reset  
- `ping <IP>` – Basic connectivity  
- `tracert <host>` – See packet route  
- `nslookup <domain>` – Check DNS resolution

---

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. Confirm IP address  
2. Ping gateway  
3. Ping public IP (8.8.8.8)  
4. Ping domain name (google.com)  
5. `tracert` for route analysis  
6. `netstat -a` to see open ports

## Notes

- APIPA (169.254.x.x) = No DHCP response  
- Use `ipconfig /flushdns` for DNS issues  
- Layer 1 issues = Check physical cables first
