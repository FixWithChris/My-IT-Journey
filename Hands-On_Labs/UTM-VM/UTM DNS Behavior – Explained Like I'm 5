# 🧠 UTM DNS Behavior – Explained Like I'm 5

**Date:** 2025-06-01  
**Environment:** Windows 11 ARM in UTM (v4.6.5)

## 🏠 What Happened

Inside my Windows virtual machine, I could:

- ✅ Browse the internet  
- ✅ Open websites like google.com  
- ❌ But `nslookup google.com` didn't work  
- ❌ PowerShell didn't show the usual prompt afterwards

---

## 👦🏽 Imagine This...

> My Windows VM is like a little kid in a house (my Mac).

- When the kid uses a **browser**, he asks:  
  > “Mom! Where’s Google?”  
  And Mom (my Mac) replies with the answer.

- But when the kid uses a **walkie-talkie** (`nslookup`), he says:  
  > “Breaker breaker, where’s Google?”  
  And no one answers—just static.

---

## 🎯 What This Means

- The browser works because Windows asks **the Mac’s DNS system** directly.  
- `nslookup` fails because the virtual machine:  
  - Doesn’t know the proper DNS server  
  - Or UTM’s network mode doesn’t let the walkie-talkie (low-level tool) reach out

---

## ✅ Do I Need to Fix It?

**No.**  
As long as websites load and updates work, the walkie-talkie isn’t needed unless I’m doing advanced networking stuff.

But if I ever want to:
- Use DNS tools from the command line  
- Do labs that need `nslookup`, `ping`, or `tracert`  
- Or troubleshoot networks like a real IT tech...

Then I’ll need to either:
- **Switch UTM to Bridged Networking**, or  
- **Manually set my DNS to 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1** in PowerShell.

## 🧰 Summary

| Tool        | Working? | Why                     |
|-------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Browser     | ✅       | Uses internal Mac DNS    |
| nslookup    | ❌       | Needs direct DNS access  |
| ping IP     | ✅       | IP-level access is fine  |
| ping domain | ❌       | DNS name can’t resolve   |

## 🧠 Final Thought

> “You don’t always need the walkie-talkie if Mom’s answering the important stuff.”

But it’s good to know how to fix it when you want to be the one in charge.
