**üîå Copper Cable Tools**

**1. Wiremap Tester**  
- **Purpose:** Verifies correct pinout on twisted pair cabling (straight-through or crossover).  
- **Use Case:** Confirms T568A vs T568B termination.  
- **Can't Use For:** Fiber cables or signal quality.

**2. Tone Generator & Probe (Fox & Hound)**  
- **Purpose:** Locates specific cables in a bundle or wall.  
- **Use Case:** Tracing runs in structured cabling.  
- **Can't Use For:** Testing continuity or signal integrity.

**3. Time-Domain Reflectometer (TDR)**  
- **Purpose:** Identifies breaks, shorts, or cable length in copper.  
- **Use Case:** Locating physical layer faults or kinks in UTP.  
- **Can't Use For:** Fiber cables (use OTDR instead).

**4. Cable Certifier**  
- **Purpose:** Verifies performance of copper links to specific standards (Cat 5e, Cat 6, etc.).  
- **Use Case:** Commercial installations.  
- **Bonus:** May include wiremap + attenuation tests.

**üî¶ Fiber Cable Tools**

**1. Optical Loss Test Set (OLTS)**  
- **Purpose:** Measures total signal loss across a fiber link (in dB).  
- **Use Case:** Certifies fiber connections and budget compliance.  
- **Strength:** Industry standard for link validation.  

**2. Optical Time-Domain Reflectometer (OTDR)**  
- **Purpose:** Detects faults, breaks, and splice loss in fiber.  
- **Use Case:** Long-distance diagnostics and bend detection.  
- **Extra:** Shows distance to fault using light reflection timing.

**3. Visual Fault Locator (VFL)**  
- **Purpose:** Sends visible red laser through fiber to locate breaks or bends.  
- **Use Case:** Quick on-site diagnostics.  
- **Limit:** Doesn‚Äôt give exact measurements like OTDR.
