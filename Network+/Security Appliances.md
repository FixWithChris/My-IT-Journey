## üîß Key Security Appliances Breakdown

---

**1. IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**  
- **What it does:** Monitors traffic and **alerts** on suspicious activity  
- **Active Blocking?** ‚ùå No  
- **Position:** Tap or SPAN port (out-of-band)  
- **Strength:** Detects attack patterns without disrupting flow  
- **Weakness:** Alert fatigue, reactive only

---

**2. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**  
- **What it does:** Monitors traffic and **blocks** known threats in real-time  
- **Active Blocking?** ‚úÖ Yes  
- **Position:** Inline with traffic  
- **Strength:** Stops attacks (DoS, malware, exploits)  
- **Weakness:** Can block legit traffic if misconfigured

---

**3. NGFW (Next-Gen Firewall)**  
- **What it does:** Combines firewall + **DPI**, **IPS**, **app awareness**, threat intelligence  
- **Think:** Stateful + IDS/IPS + Layer 7  
- **Use Case:** Modern enterprise edge protection  
- **Bonus:** Can decrypt and inspect SSL traffic (SSL inspection)

---

**4. UTM (Unified Threat Management)**  
- **What it does:** All-in-one appliance:  
  - Firewall  
  - IPS/IDS  
  - Antivirus  
  - Spam filter  
  - VPN  
  - Web filtering  
- **Use Case:** Small/medium businesses (cost-effective bundle)

---

**5. Proxy Server**  
- **What it does:** Acts as intermediary between client and internet  
- **Types:**
  - **Forward Proxy:** Controls outbound traffic  
  - **Reverse Proxy:** Protects servers from inbound traffic  
- **Use Case:** Caching, URL filtering, hiding IPs

---

**6. DLP (Data Loss Prevention)**  
- **What it does:** Scans data in use, at rest, in motion to prevent sensitive data exfiltration  
- **Use Case:** Stops SSNs, credit card data, IP from leaking  
- **Strength:** Policy enforcement  
- **Deployed As:** Agent on endpoints, network-based, or cloud-based

---

**7. VPN Concentrator**  
- **What it does:** Manages large-scale **VPN sessions** (IPsec, SSL)  
- **Use Case:** Secure remote access for workforce  
- **Bonus:** May include authentication, logging, encryption hardware acceleration

---

**8. NAC (Network Access Control)**  
- **What it does:** Evaluates device health and **controls network entry**  
- **Checkpoints:** Patch level, antivirus status, domain membership  
- **Use Case:** Quarantine untrusted devices before giving access  
- **Bonus:** Often works with 802.1X authentication

| IDS              | Detect & alert             | ‚ùå No    | Layer 3/4/7    |
| IPS              | Detect & block             | ‚úÖ Yes   | Layer 3/4/7    |
| NGFW             | Full-spectrum firewall     | ‚úÖ Yes   | Layer 3‚Äì7      |
| UTM              | All-in-one security        | ‚úÖ Yes   | Multi-layer    |
| Proxy            | Traffic mediation          | ‚úÖ Yes   | Layer 7        |
| DLP              | Data monitoring/prevention | ‚úÖ Yes   | App/Data Layer |
| VPN Concentrator | Secure remote tunnels      | ‚úÖ Yes   | Layer 3 (VPN)  |
| NAC              | Gatekeeping network access | ‚úÖ Yes   | Layer 2‚Äì3      |

## üí° Exam Tips

- **IDS = detection only, no blocking**
- **IPS = inline blocking**
- **UTM = all-in-one**
- **NGFW = DPI + IPS + app visibility**
- **Proxy = gateway that masks clients or protects servers**
- **DLP = prevents sensitive data from leaking**
- **NAC = decides who gets on the network**
