## ðŸ§  Study Log: May 23â€“25, 2025  
**Focus:** Network+ | A+ Core 1 & 2 | Technical Mastery  

**Total Hours Logged:** 18â€“21 hours  

### Topics Covered:
#### Network+
- VLANs, trunk ports, and inter-VLAN routing  
- Static vs Dynamic IP addressing  
- Subnetting drills (block sizes, ranges, 3rd octet mastery)  
- DHCP, DNS, and IPAM integration  
- WAN technologies (MPLS, Metro-E, DSL, Satellite)  
- Cloud computing models (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS)  
- SDN, SD-WAN, and VXLAN tunneling  
- Protocol mastery (NFS, CIFS, HTTP, RDMA comparison)  
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP, RSTP)  
- Ethernet frames and MAC-based delivery  

#### A+ Core 1 & 2
- Laptop display troubleshooting (inverter, backlight, GPU)  
- Wireless standards (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax)  
- Wireless encryption (WPA2, WPA3, CCMP, GCMP)  
- Mobile IDs: IMEI vs IMSI  
- Windows encryption: Device Encryption vs BitLocker  
- Remote Desktop access methods (RDP name vs IP)  
- Fibre Channel HBA for SAN connections  
- Installation environments (IDF, MDF, patch panels, racks)  
- IP conflict and DNS coordination via IPAM

### Key Reflections:
- **Biggest breakthrough:** Fully grasped subnetting logic and applied it fluidly.  
- **New awareness:** NAS vs SAN protocol stack differences + storage layer mapping.  
- **Emerging confidence:** Comfort explaining STP, DHCP-DNS syncing, encryption tiers.
